# org-davep-nntp

Simple NNTP client for Common Lisp.

## Commentary

The following code was written while doing three things:

- Reading RFC977.
- Reading RFC2980.
- Playing against a local NNTP server (INN).

So, keeping this in mind, don't be surprised to find that I've either
misread either of the RFCs or that I've gone and done something a little too
INN specific. If you see anything please feel free to let me know and/or
supply a fix.
